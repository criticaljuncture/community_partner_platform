        Community Schools leverage community partnerships and resources so our
        campuses become hubs of support and opportunity for students, families
        and community members. By working with the community in this way,
        schools become better equipped to tap into the unique talents and
        gifts of every student, teacher, and staff member in our district, and
        can better break down barriers to student achievement.

        OUSD uses the Community Partner Platform to organize and track our
        partnerships. As a parent, teacher, student or community member you can
        use this web platform to learn more about the organizations we partner
        with and the programs they provide.
